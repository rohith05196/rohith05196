# 👋 Hi there! I'm Rohith

I’m a **Mechatronics Engineer** with a strong background in **software development**, passionate about building intelligent systems through control, automation, and machine learning. With a strong bacground in Mecahnical engineering previously, I have vouched to be a complete engineer with core fundamental skills and an added layer of programming skills. Recently I have delved deep into some projects in ML, Control systems and software development including an attempt to get my hands dirty on full stack delevopment as well wherein I have been using `html` and `Flask`. So this is a warehouse which would include some of my works where I try to get my hands dirty on trying out new things and learning. 

🚀 I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies — constantly learning through hands-on projects in **ML**, **simulation**, and **system design**.
