## About Me
I am a mechanical engineer and a tech geek, always curious to learn and explore. I enjoy stepping outside my comfort zone to try out new technologies and approaches, especially in software engineering, AI, and machine learning. The repositories hosted here are my attempt to capture and experiment with solutions to real-world problems. They are not perfect, but they reflect my drive to learn, test, and share.

If you notice bugs or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to create an issue — I will tackle them as soon as possible. And if you have new ideas that could be implemented as a team, I will be glad to hear them. You can always reach out to me through any of the platforms linked here. I believe tech is best explored together, and I will always stay open to learning, building, and growing with others.

## Interests
- Formula 1 – where the fusion of mechanical design, aerodynamics, and team strategies in a race (and beyond) amazes me, showing how engineering excellence and collective decision-making shape outcomes at the highest level.
- Aviation systems – where the challenge of integrating mechanical, software, and safety-critical systems fascinates me, especially how every detail matters for reliability and performance.
- Mechanical design – where turning concepts into practical solutions excites me, from CAD modeling to prototyping, and seeing how design choices influence real-world functionality.
- Wind energy – a domain where I work professionally, combining sustainability with engineering and software systems, where turbines integrate control, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and digital tools to deliver clean power for the future.

# Beyond Code: My Language Journey

Beyond just being a technology enthusisat and curious engineer I am also a language fanatic.

Just as the phrase says:
- „Sprache öffnet Türen, die Technik allein nicht kann.“ (DE 🇩🇪)
- 「言葉は心をつなぎ、技術は未来を築く。」(JP 🇯🇵)

For me, technology builds systems, but language builds bridges. My German journey has been a fun ride — from the early days of „Ich kann nur ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen, mit Karte bitte, zum Mitnehmen.“ to sentences like „Ich freue mich darauf, neue Leute kennenzulernen und mein Deutsch jeden Tag zu verbessern.“ Each step feels like unlocking a new achievement.

I already have a good hold of Japanese 🇯🇵 and keep sharpening it everytime the opportunities knock my door, alongside the five regional Indian languages I speak. Every new language feels like a new lens to see the world — and I will keep stacking them as long as curiosity drives me.

And apart from talking just technical, we could also grab a cup of digital coffee ☕ to exchange ideas, improve our languages, and keep learning together.



### Let’s Connect
If you’ve got an idea that blends **mechanical + software + AI** or even standalone projects that you would love to explore together, reach out to me on LinkedIn or open an issue here.  
I’m always up for building something new and exciting.
